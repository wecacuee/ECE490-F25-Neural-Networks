2. Follow the [new user instructions](https://operations.access-ci.org/identity/new-user)

3. Set your password using the [PSC Password Change Utility](https://apr.psc.edu/)

## Running Jupyter on PSC with SLURM
4. Follow next set of instructions [to run jupyter on PSC with SLURM](0000-00-06-acg-slurm-jupyter.md)

# Method 2: WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) on Windows on your machine.

1. Install PowerShell on Windows
    [Installing PowerShell on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3)
2. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux

```
4. List the Ubuntu versions available to be installed
```shell
wsl --set-default-version 2
wsl --list --online
```

3. Install Ubuntu 22.04
```shell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
```
4. Launch wsl: Press Windows, search wsl

## Within WSL

In WSL>Ubuntu-22.04 python comes pre-installed.

1. Launch WSL

2. Type `python3`, press enter

3. Enter any python code 
```python
print("hello world!")
```
Press enter.

## Within WSL as a file

0. Launch WSL

1. Create a text file using notepad or your favorite editer. Enter any python
   code within the file.
```python
print("hello world!")
```
Save the file as first.py

2. From the terminal run the python script `first.py`

```shell
user@machine:~$ python3 first.py
hello world!
```

## Install Jupyter lab

0. Launch WSL

2. Install pip
```shell
user@machine:~$  sudo apt install python3-pip
```
2. Install Jupyter lab using pip
```shell
user@machine:~$  pip3 install --user jupyterlab
```

3. Run Jupyter lab
```shell
user@machine:~$  jupyter lab --ip $(hostname -I)
```

4. Open the URL printer on the screen with the token in a browser of your
   choice.

4. Click on Notebook > Python 3 > ipykernel

5. Enter any python code 
```python
print("hello world!")
```
Press Ctrl+Enter

# Easiest: Method 3: Google colab

1. Open <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true"
   target="_blank" >https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true</a>

2. Enter any python code
```python
print("hello world!")
```
Press Control+Enter to run


3. The colab notebooks are saved in your Google drive > Colabs. You can
   organize them by clicking on File > Move
